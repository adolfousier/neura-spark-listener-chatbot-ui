## Change Log

### v0.3.6 

- Implemented a DEFAULT_WELCOME_MESSAGE flag
- Improved the chatbubble adding settings, theme and web search dropdown

### v0.3.5 

- New Component Created : Added a new component `WebChatAssistant.tsx` . This component is responsible for:
- Displaying a chat bubble button using the /mingcute_chat.png image when the VITE_BOXED_CHAT_UI environment variable is set to true .
- Toggling a fixed-position, boxed chat window when the bubble is clicked.
- Integrating the existing `MessageList` and `MessageInput` components within this boxed UI.
- Ensuring that a chat conversation is active (either by selecting an existing one or creating a new one) when the chat window is opened, utilizing the `useChat` hook.
- Application Integration : The new `WebChatAssistant` component has been integrated into your main `App.tsx` . It's rendered conditionally based on the VITE_BOXED_CHAT_UI environment variable, allowing it to appear globally across your application when enabled.

### v0.3.4

**Fix**: Azure blob storage type missmatch 

### v0.3.3 

**apiService.ts Refactor**

### v0.3.2 

**Fix**: Mermaid rendering.

Key Changes:

- Zero Dependencies: useEffect([], []) - NO dependencies,
 renders once on mount only
- Global Cache: Results are cached in window.mermaidCache
 - same diagram never re-renders
- Direct DOM Manipulation: Uses innerHTML directly instea
d of React state
- Multiple Guards: hasRenderedRef, mountedRef prevent any
 re-execution
- Removed ALL React.memo: No more memoization complexity
- Removed useCallback: No more callback dependencies

### v0.3.1

**Fix**: README update and MarkdownRendered refactor

### v0.3.0

1.  **Updated AI Models**: Updated OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Groq, and Neura models.
2.  **Fixed Diagram Resizing/Re-rendering Issue**: Workd better with Sonnet, Opus, o4-mini etc...
    *   Added `isRendered` state to prevent multiple renders of the same diagram.
    *   Used empty dependency array `[]` in Mermaid initialization to run only once.
    *   Added debouncing (300ms) to theme changes to prevent excessive re-renders.
    *   Improved responsive SVG handling by modifying the SVG attributes directly.
3.  **Added Mermaid SVG Download Functionality**:
    *   Added a Download button next to the copy button.
    *   Implemented `handleDownloadSVG` function that creates a blob and triggers download.
    *   The SVG file is named `mermaid-diagram-{diagramId}.svg`.
    *   Added proper tooltip for the download button.
    *   Debounced theme changes to avoid rapid re-initialization.
4.  **Chat ID's Browser Path**:
    *   Added a new `chatId` to the browser path
